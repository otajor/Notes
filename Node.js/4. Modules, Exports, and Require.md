## 16. Conceptual Aside: Modules
* Module: a reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code. Javascript didn't use to have this.
* CommonJS Modules: an agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

## 17. First-class Functions
* Everything you can do with other types, you can do with functions. 
* An expression: a block of code that results in a value. Function expressions are possible in javascript because of first class functions.
```javascript
// function statement:
function greet(){
	console.log('hi');
}
// function expression (assigned to a variable):
var greetMe = function() {
	console.log('Hi Tony');
}
```

## 18. Let's Build a Module
* `require` takes one parameter - string containing the location or name of the module that you wish to import.
* module.exports is how to export things from one module to another to be used there. Otherwise they are protected.
