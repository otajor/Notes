## Scopes
* Lexical scope: the regions of source code where you can refer to a variable by name without getting access errors.
* A new lexical scope is created in every new function definition. 
* In theory you can declare variables without the `var` keyword, in which case it will be added to the global scope. This is bad practice.
* Loops DO NOT create new scopes. Only curly brackets on FUNCTION STATEMENTS create new scopes.
*'In memory scopes' are the contexts that are created when you run the code.
