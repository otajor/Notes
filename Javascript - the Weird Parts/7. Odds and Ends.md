### 65: Initialisation
* Sometimes it is difficult to read initialised data when it is sprawling down the page and has lots of objects within arrays within arrays within objects etc. White space is useful, comments are useful, and IDEs are useful for highlighting where brackets start and end.
* Make sure to use colons, not equal signs when using object literal syntax.

### 67: 'typeof', 'instanceof', and Figuring Out What Something Is
* `typeof` tells us what type something is.
* `typeof []` returns 'object' because arrays are object.
 * We can get around this by doing `Object.prototype.toString.call(d)` where d is your array. This calls the toString function but passes in your array as the argument. It returns `[object Array]`.
* `e instanceof Person` tells you if anywhere down the prototype chain from the object e, there is the object Person. If so, then e is an instance of Person, and instanceof returns true.
* `typeof undefined` returns 'undefined'.
* `typeof null` returns 'object' - this is a bug, but can no longer be fixed.
* `typeof z` where z is a function returns 'function'.

### 67: Strict Mode
* This is a way to opt in to more rules for writing javascript. You do this by writing `"use strict"` at the top of the page (or at the top of a function, which makes only that exectution context strict. This institutes various rules which make it harder to make errors in your code.
